The diff also includes changes not requested (project_state.json feature-request bookkeeping and backend authorization logic changes unrelated to the reset code).",

      "requirement": "Update the backend emergency ownership reset authorization key so that calling emergencyResetOwnership only succeeds when the provided reset code equals \"73024141\" (and other codes trap with \"Unauthorized: Invalid emergency reset code\"), and the successful call sets currentOwner to null and ownershipClaimable to true.",
      "reason": "In the provided truncated backend/main.mo diff excerpt, there is no visible emergencyResetOwnership function nor any constant/key being set to \"73024141\", and no evidence of the required success/trap behavior change.",
