REQ-3 (backend exact-match authorization code 73024141 enforced in emergencyResetOwnership with trap on mismatch) is not verifiable from the provided backend diff excerpt because emergencyResetOwnership and the reset code check are not shown. REQ-2 (publish/deploy to resolve draft-expired) cannot be verified from code diffs.",
